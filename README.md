# HDC Project Backend

## Introduction

- HDC Project Backend. Contains neural network which forecasts number of deaths based on country's attributes.

## Model Structure

- Neural Network made with TensorFlow; model interfaced by keras.
- General Layer Struure:
  1. Input Layer; 22 Nodes to represent each feature.
  2. Normalization layer; 22 Nodes
  3. Hidden Layer w/ RelU activation function; 217 nodes
  4. Output Layer w/ linear activation function; 1 node

- JSON is generated by for frontend [repository](https://github.com/grant-sobkowski/hdc-frontend).

## Process

- Model forecasts deaths for vanilla values in csv, substitutes the 90th percentile of one value - then compares the two. This is repeated for each policy and each country. Exported as JSON and used in [repository](https://github.com/grant-sobkowski/hdc-frontend)

## Project Structure

- The hdc-react/ directory holds the projects main folders and files. Within this directory are the following:
  - /data_processing - Has Jupyter notebooks and scripts to process csvs into relavent data.
  - /dnn_model - Compiled Tensorflow model
  - /json - Contains cleaned csv and certain model outputs
  - /misc - Misc. cleaning scripts/debugging
  - /model_training - Scripts to train neural network
  - /training_data - OWID covid CSVs
